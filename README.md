To me, music means an escape! Music is tranquility and fluidity of spirit within ones self. Music is expression, it is how I breakdown things for better understanding. The most valuable thing that music is, is different. One piece of music can be 10 different things to 10 different people. It can also reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, decrease cortisol (stress hormone) levels and increase serotonin and endorphin levels in the blood. It elevates mood. Music can boost the brain's production of the hormone dopamine. This increased dopamine production helps relieve feelings of anxiety and depression.
